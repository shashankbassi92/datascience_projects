Details:
Code is present in the directory code.

Data is present in the directory data

Final predictions are in the home directory as shashank_bassi_predictions.csv

How to run this project?
1. `conda create -n redventures`
2. `conda activate redventures`
3. `pip install -r code/requirements.txt`
4. `python code/ds_pipeline.py`

These above steps will read & transform data, create features, create model, evaluate model, create predictions and save the predictions as shashank_bassi_predictions.csv.

P.S.: All my exploration of data and features is present in code/explore.ipynb.
I will be happy to receive any feedback.
